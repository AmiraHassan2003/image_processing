🖥️ Image Processing GUI Application with Custom Operations

  Welcome to the Image Processing GUI Application! This project features a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform various image processing techniques using custom implementations from scratch, focusing on learning and practical experimentation.

📜 Project Overview
This project was a team-based collaborative effort focused on developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for image processing. It allows users to upload images and apply a variety of image transformations and operations like:

Grayscale conversion
- Thresholding
- Edge detection (Sobel, Prewitt, Kirsch)
- Histogram equalization
- Gaussian-based edge detection methods
- High-pass, low-pass, and median filtering
The project uses Python and is built with custom logic for each operation—no built-in shortcuts!

🚀 Features
✨ User Interface
The GUI provides:

 -- Image Upload: Easily upload an image from your device.
 -- Dynamic Processing: View processed results in real-time.
Simple & Advanced Image Operations:
 -- Grayscale conversion
 -- Threshold-based halftone
 -- Histogram equalization
 -- Edge detection methods like Sobel, Prewitt, and Kirsch operators
 -- Gaussian difference edge detection
 -- Low-pass/high-pass filtering and median filters
💻 Tech Stack
🛠️ Languages & Tools Used:

Python
OpenCV (for basic image operations)
Custom implementations (no built-in shortcuts for learning purposes)
GUI Development: Tkinter or other Python-based GUI frameworks
